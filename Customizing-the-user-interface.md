> The thread-view is using Webkit to render the messages, the style and layout can be customized by editing the HTML and SCSS files.

You can copy the standard HTML and SCSS file from the [ui/ directory](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/tree/master/ui) to `~/.config/astroid/ui/` and then customize them to your own needs. Astroid will check if the version is correct (do not change it yourself), in case a new version is released upstream.

> SCSS works much like CSS, but it is preprocessed at startup using [libsass](http://sass-lang.com/libsass).

You can change `font-size`, `font-family` and some other variables for the whole style by just setting the SCSS variables at the top of [thread-view.scss](https://github.com/gauteh/astroid/blob/master/ui/thread-view.scss).

##### Only change variable settings - and use the rest of the default styles
If you only want to change the standard variables, but still use the default theme and _follow_ any updates made upstream, create a `~/.config/astroid/ui/thread-view.scss` file, set the variables, and then include the standard file:

> Remember to keep the version line at the top intact!

```css
/* ui-version: 3 (do not change when modifying theme for yourself) */
/* Variables */
/* Background colors associated with received emails: */
$recv-normal: #ffffff;
$recv-quoted: #e8e8e8;
$recv-collapsed: #f5f5f5;
/* Background colors associated with sent emails: */
$sent-normal: #ffffff;
