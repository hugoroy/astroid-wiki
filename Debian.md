On Debian Testing (Stretch) the package list is similar to [[Ubuntu]] but I was able to build astroid with only these packages;
```
$ apt install scons g++ libboost1.58-all-dev libnotmuch-dev libglibmm-2.4-dev libwebkitgtk-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libgmime-2.6-dev libsass-dev libwebkitgtk-3.0-dev
```
With those packages installed I was also able to run the test suite without any errors detected as well as run astroid successfully.
